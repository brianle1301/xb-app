Worse? Does the movement change over the week? How do you feel after each section? Overall?\n\nIn the daily practice there are three parts\n\n**small moves** this week focus on the ankles\n\n**bigger moves** focus on starting to explore the ground for strength, mobility, balance.\n\n**breath moves** focus on a familiar movement – walking outside – combined with breathing explorations.\n\n** The next section – Lab set up – demonstrates these moves."

          "content": "Explore the Floor: Ground Moves\n \nWe’re going to build a simple series of moves into a flow to explore the ground – you’ll see what these mean.\n\nThe first place to start is **Neutral Quad**\n\nKnees and hands on the ground with knees below hips and hands below shoulders. That’s our NEUTRAL position.\n \n[image]\n \nYou can explore that **Neutral Quad** position with these TARGETS in mind.\n\n1.        How does NEUTRAL feel?\n2.        What if you lean forward a bit? Back a bit? Anything change? (Rule 1: never move into pain).\n3.        What if you keep your arms straight like they are and **turn your elbows in and out** while keeping your hands planted where they are, on the ground?\n4.        Explore pressing  DOWN into the ground with your hands and ROUND/PULL your shoulders up as high as they’ll go – it’s not rounding your back; it’s lifting your shoulders. Do you feel that at all in your middle?\n5.        What happens going in the opposite direction: let your spine drop – but not your arms/shoulders – you hang/relax your middle?\n6.        Last, back to neutral, from neurtral explore moving JUST your side as far to the right as possible – for that stretch – where do you feel the stretch? Then, try it to the left – how’s that?\n7.        If you put each of these moves together you’ll get spine circles that you can do going Right and going Left.\n\n**Marking Progress**: each day just be aware of how these movements change from what feels easier, harder; where the range of motion feels bigger or looser. Concentrate on where the Stretch feels – seek that sensation out – gently. Find where the muscles pull together  or push away.\n\n**Next Move: A-Frame**\n\nNext move is the A-frame. This move is simply to lift your butt from the Neutral Quad, to keep your feet and hands on the floor.\n\n![](assets/box/move/move-mc-bear-AFRAME.jpg)\n\nThe focus is on the hips: to PUSH these up as high as possible\n\nThe movement is to explore how close you can get your feet to your hands and keep that shape of an A frame (upside down V).\n\nTargets: FEEL the hips pushing up to the sky; Feel your hands and feet pushing into the ground – make the frame feel ACTIVE\n\n**MARKING PROGRESS**: IF straightening your legs is a challenge; if keeping your arms in line with your back is a challenge – that’s fine. START WITH WHERE YOU ARE. IT’s a great way to see how the movement evolves over the week. – do legs/arms get straighter at your closest position of feet and hands together?\n\n**Final Move: the Squat.**\n\nFrom the A-frame, walk your feet forward – which will bring your hips down – let your hands come up – that will let your back move into the vertical – and that will get you into a squat.\n\n![](/public/assets/box/move/move-squat.jpg)\n\n**Targets:** Focus on where you are with your squat. If youd but isn’t going down all the way – that’s ok – how does this very basic human move feel? where does it feel tight? Where does it feel loose? Where do you want to hang onto something? And if you feel totally groovy that’s grand. Explore rocking from side to side a bit to see if one side feels different from the other – if how low you go or how it feels changes from day to day.\n\n**THE FLOW**\n\nNow we’re going to put these individual movements together.\n\n1.        Start by standing.\n2.        Lower yourself to the ground – with as little support as possible\n3.        Move into the Neutral Quad\n4.        Do a few circles in one direction; then do the other – really focus on the shoulder round, the side stretch the spinal drop (like the ground is pulling your middle towards it)\n5.        Lift your hips into the A frame and adjust your feet and hands to get to that hips up, and your legs as straight as possible and as close together as possible maintaining that high hips shape.\n6.        Now walk your feet into the squat. Pause there\n7.        REVERSE – put your hands back on the ground and move back into a frame\n8.        Lower your knees into neutral quad\n9.        Do your circles one direction then the other.\n10.  Sit up – if you can sit on your feet great – if not that’s ok – just sit for a moment, and stand back up.\n\n**That’s your flow.**\n\nTIME – If you set a timer for Five minutes – or just look at the clock – give this sequence a go for at least a minute – pause between any part of the sequence as long as you need to to recover and see if you can do the five minutes – as beautifully as possible.\n\nFOCUS on making the movements as clear and clean and lovely as possible – no kidding – not on how many you can do.\n\nWHEN  Any time of the day that you can take five minutes for yourself. You can also practice any PART of this flow for 10-15 seconds any time of the day you’d like.\n\n·       The Neutral Quad moves are nice stretches as well as strength building\n\n·       Squats are great any time of the day to explore whole body mobility and strength\n\n·       Lowering from standing into Squat, and standing up from squat – towards no hands – is also a good strength and balance move.\n\n·       A frame to squat and back to A-frame – can be done anywhere you’d like to stretch out your back – like sitting at a computer for hours.\n \n \n "
