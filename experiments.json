            "content": "Explore the Floor: Ground Moves\n \nWe’re going to build a simple series of moves into a flow to explore the ground – you’ll see what these mean.\n\nThe first place to start is **Neutral Quad**\n\nKnees and hands on the ground with knees below hips and hands below shoulders. That’s our NEUTRAL position.\n \n[image]\n \nYou can explore that **Neutral Quad** position with these TARGETS in mind.\n\n1.        How does NEUTRAL feel?\n2.        What if you lean forward a bit? Back a bit? Anything change? (Rule 1: never move into pain).\n3.        What if you keep your arms straight like they are and **turn your elbows in and out** while keeping your hands planted where they are, on the ground?\n4.        Explore pressing  DOWN into the ground with your hands and ROUND/PULL your shoulders up as high as they’ll go – it’s not rounding your back; it’s lifting your shoulders. Do you feel that at all in your middle?\n5.        What happens going in the opposite direction: let your spine drop – but not your arms/shoulders – you hang/relax your middle?\n6.        Last, back to neutral, from neurtral explore moving JUST your side as far to the right as possible – for that stretch – where do you feel the stretch? Then, try it to the left – how’s that?\n7.        If you put each of these moves together you’ll get spine circles that you can do going Right and going Left.\n\n**Marking Progress**: each day just be aware of how these movements change from what feels easier, harder; where the range of motion feels bigger or looser. Concentrate on where the Stretch feels – seek that sensation out – gently. Find where the muscles pull together  or push away.\n\n**Next Move: A-Frame**\n\nNext move is the A-frame. This move is simply to lift your butt from the Neutral Quad, to keep your feet and hands on the floor.\n\n![](assets/box/move/move-mc-bear-AFRAME.jpg)\n\nThe focus is on the hips: to PUSH these up as high as possible\n\nThe movement is to explore how close you can get your feet to your hands and keep that shape of an A frame (upside down V).\n\nTargets: FEEL the hips pushing up to the sky; Feel your hands and feet pushing into the ground – make the frame feel ACTIVE\n\n**MARKING PROGRESS**: IF straightening your legs is a challenge; if keeping your arms in line with your back is a challenge – that’s fine. START WITH WHERE YOU ARE. IT’s a great way to see how the movement evolves over the week. – do legs/arms get straighter at your closest position of feet and hands together?\n\n**Final Move: the Squat.**\n\nFrom the A-frame, walk your feet forward – which will bring your hips down – let your hands come up – that will let your back move into the vertical – and that will get you into a squat.\n\n![](/public/assets/box/move/move-squat.jpg)\n\n**Targets:** Focus on where you are with your squat. If youd but isn’t going down all the way – that’s ok – how does this very basic human move feel? where does it feel tight? Where does it feel loose? Where do you want to hang onto something? And if you feel totally groovy that’s grand. Explore rocking from side to side a bit to see if one side feels different from the other – if how low you go or how it feels changes from day to day.\n\n**THE FLOW**\n\nNow we’re going to put these individual movements together.\n\n1.        Start by standing.\n2.        Lower yourself to the ground – with as little support as possible\n3.        Move into the Neutral Quad\n4.        Do a few circles in one direction; then do the other – really focus on the shoulder round, the side stretch the spinal drop (like the ground is pulling your middle towards it)\n5.        Lift your hips into the A frame and adjust your feet and hands to get to that hips up, and your legs as straight as possible and as close together as possible maintaining that high hips shape.\n6.        Now walk your feet into the squat. Pause there\n7.        REVERSE – put your hands back on the ground and move back into a frame\n8.        Lower your knees into neutral quad\n9.        Do your circles one direction then the other.\n10.  Sit up – if you can sit on your feet great – if not that’s ok – just sit for a moment, and stand back up.\n\n**That’s your flow.**\n\nTIME – If you set a timer for Five minutes – or just look at the clock – give this sequence a go for at least a minute – pause between any part of the sequence as long as you need to to recover and see if you can do the five minutes – as beautifully as possible.\n\nFOCUS on making the movements as clear and clean and lovely as possible – no kidding – not on how many you can do.\n\nWHEN  Any time of the day that you can take five minutes for yourself. You can also practice any PART of this flow for 10-15 seconds any time of the day you’d like.\n\n·       The Neutral Quad moves are nice stretches as well as strength building\n\n·       Squats are great any time of the day to explore whole body mobility and strength\n\n·       Lowering from standing into Squat, and standing up from squat – towards no hands – is also a good strength and balance move.\n\n·       A frame to squat and back to A-frame – can be done anywhere you’d like to stretch out your back – like sitting at a computer for hours.\n \n \n "

How do you feel at the end of that session of nasal breathing on the go?\n\nWalking is a great way to help feel and explore how your other movement work is benefiting you. So in this walk you get to focus on how you feel, where you feel it.  \n\nAre you walking more smoothly? Feel lighter? More responsive to the world beneath your feet? More stable?  \n\nHow is your breathing? Deep and easy from below your ribs rather than up high in your chest? How many steps does each breath take? More? Fewer than last week?  \n\n**For the Movement Snacks** – remember a target is to work hard enough that your breathing is a little harder than normal, so you’re putting in some effort. Just observe how long you can keep nasal breathing as the effort increases. How hard can you go and maintain that nose-only breathing in and out *before* you feel the need to breath in through your mouth?\n\nJust be aware for those 1-2 minutes of your Movement Snacks what’s happening – you don’t have to keep this focus for ALL your snacks – afterall you’re also learning these new movements and want to focus on doing them – but keep this in mind for your practice this week – you’ll be amazed at how this feeling evolves over the week.\n**** \n**PREP:**\n\n**For your walk:** What do you need to prepare for yourself – to plan – to make it as easy as possible in order to get in a daily walk, focusing on your nasal breathing, and how you feel? \n\nPlan B: Any time of the day for this walk activity is great – to combine your walk with early morning daylight is fantastic – and of course if the weather is dire – give yourself a break. Where else can you walk – can you plan that out ahead of time just in case?  \n\n**For your Movement Snacks that add in Nasal Breathing**  How would you help yourself remember to Nasal Breath for a minute or two for some of your snacks? Is it a sticky on your desk? A reminder on your phone? Whatever works for you.\n \nEnjoy! \n "

            "content": "This week we're exploring TWO fundamentals of movement. \n\n## Shift Points and Jumps\n\n **Shift Points** happen  in a movement practices where you first feel in a movement it's going from easy to “that’s work, now.” \n\nWhether you're doing a MOVEMENT SNACK like a Bear Walk, running to the next lamp post, doing some sit stands with a timer, we can feel the effort level shift.  \n\nSometimes that shift feels like ok that movement just went from fun to work, and I’d like to stop now.  \n\nSometimes that shift feels like you found your second wind and whatever you’re doing feels faster and less effortful.  \n\nIt’s not uncommon to hit both those points in one session. \n\nThese Shift Points are very helpful in developing our resilience – our capacity to move and recover and thrive.  \n\nIn order to work with these shift points, we need to practice **finding, feeling and identifying** them. From there we can start to work with the shift points deliberately to make sure we're building *better* all the tiime. That’s what this week is all about. \n\nYou'll explore shift points in the animal moves, your breath work, and in exploring one more move you likely first played with as a kid: jumps.  \n\n \n**A great way to feel those shift points is with Jumps for Time.**\n\nThere are many types of jumps. These include things like simply jumping up, jumping to the side, jumping to turn from front to back, and back again, jumping forward and back.\n\nOther types of jumps may be jumping up onto something, or really powerful: jumping down from something and springing right back up again.\n\nFor upper body to benefit from this approach, this could be leaning into a wall, pushing off and landing back and pushing off again, to hurling a medicine ball at a wall or the floor and catching it.\n\nAn old skool way to incorporate jumps of course is jumping rope.\n\n**We’ll look at why these Shift Points and Jumps are so fundamental in the Knowledge section.**\n\nThis week, you’ll be experimenting with ways to use shift points deliberately to build your skills to be able to move anytime, anywhere, to feel better, longer.\n \n "

These are the philosophies of *Intervals* – push a bit; pause; go again.  \n- **options to check**: **speed** (speed up or slow down – whatever feels a little easier); **load** (make the load lighter) and “**range of motion**” – how big a movement you make (instead of taking big steps in your walk, you shorten your stride).  \n- **And of course you can stop** – before starting again. Stopping to recover, with the intention to start again, is totally fine. In fact its fantastic. That STOP is a real recovery point. IT does get more energy to you to begin again. See how that feels. As you practice, you’ll notice that the stops will likely get shorter. \n- **Bonus: Shift Yourself**: sometimes a shift point occurs even before practice starts. Sitting in a chair thinking “i don’t want to go for a walk” That’s totally fine to say that to your self. The best strategy if you have committed to go for that walk, to SHIFT gears to be able to go, is just to shift positions: stand up. As soon as you shift yourself, you’ll find your feeling shifts from no to go.  \n\nThis week the key thing is to feel \n\n- WHEN a SHIFT POINT first happens in your movement practices \n- WHAT options feel good to you to continue your practice, \n- how the SHIFT points change over the course of your practice this week.   "

What are you saying to yourself when you hit that point? What strategies do you use to keep going?\n\n\n\n**EXAMPLE** For instance, you might set a clock for 1 minute, start with the intent to nasal breath as long as possible, and do monkeys non stop to be as slow and controlled as possible – you may even try *pulling*  your feet rather than leaping from one side to the other to use more effort.\n\nWhen do you get to the point of needing to breath with your mouth? Is it in that first minute, in the second minute? Or it may be easier to say is it the third monkey to the left or the fifth?\n\nAnother context may be taking the stairs up: if you’re moving at a good tempo – to move as quickly as you can safely – perhaps you take two stairs at a time even – what flight do you hit where you need to start breathing through your mouth? How do you feel? Energised? Fatigued? Can you do a few more stairs? What are you telling yourself?\n \n**Shift Points with Jumps**\n\nJumping offers an opportunity to focus on generating power – a combination of speed and force – we’ll look at what that means and why it’s fundamental for health in the knowledge section.\n\nThe idea here is to explore jumps to find that shift point – when you need to shift from nasal to mouth breathing to keep going – or do you feel fatigue even before you need to shift breathing?\n\nIF jumping is new to you, this video is a great jump tutorial from our friends at GMB"

The main thing is the movement quality: to bring your arms into play; to use that hip movement you’ve practiced in the animal moves. You can practice those moves with the smallest of leaps off the ground. If leaving the ground is too much right now, explore just doing the movement towards the leap – explore going up on your toes with your arms up – you’ll build up to it.\n \n**Bonus –upper body “jumps”**\n\nYou can explore finding shift points in working upper body “jumps” as well. You can start with a wall, and work your way to the floor for equipment free work. – or use medicine balls and bands too to build this vital practice."

            "content": "**Breath Walking Shift Points**\n\nThis week with nasal breath walking we’re exploring a kind of micro shift point. Here’s how it works:\n\nDuring your outside walk:\n\n·      Breath regularly in and out through your nose for 6 breaths – in and out\n\n·      Notice how many steps you take with each breath: is it two? Three? Four?\n\n·      After you have your sixth breath OUT (last exhalation of this cycle) hold your breath (it can help to pinch your nose).\n\n·      Count how many steps you can walk til you feel the FIRST need to breath again, and then, gently breath in and out nasally for another 6 breaths and start the cycle again.\n\n**TARGET is 12 continuous minutes** of this nasal breathing/breath holding in your walking\n\nThis practice is NOT about trying to hold your breath as long as possible – it’s about staying loose and relaxed and noticing when that air hunger starts to happen and you want to breath. Do so. As you practice this walking breathing breath-holding this week, just notice what happens in terms of how the step count may change. Over time, you’ll find that your step count increases in the breath hold. You’ll also find that your pace – how quickly you can walk and do this breathing and recovering will also improve.\n\nNote: if you find yourself having to breath in really extra deeply after your breath hold, you’ve likely tried to hold it too long. The recover breathing should be at a normal breathing level.\n\nNote 2: walking while practicing this breathing is a great way to improve nasal breathing work for your movement snacks as well."

See how you feel. \n8. OUTDOOR walk 10-12 minutes – focusing on nasal breathing /breath holding on exhalation - and how the walk feels – can be any time of day. You can explore a shift point with your breathing effort by going faster or by breathing out and holding your breath for a few steps – ONLY IF THAT FEELS SAFE TO YOU. \n9.

            "content": "Go ahead and JUMP – but why?\n\n**Movements** combine pushing, pulling, rotating, holding. They also combine speed, even if that speed is – as in the *still* moves we’ll look at in Week 4 – zero speed.\n\nMuscles are what let us move our joints. The capacity to move something through space (including moving ourselves, or a tin of soup, or a small child) is very much about out muscles.\n\n **Muscle Primer**: In particular we are looking at the amount and capacity of the muscle CELLS that make up our muscles. Like any cell in our body (almost any cell) muscle cells take in fuel to use as energy to let muscles work, repair, get stronger.\n\nWhen we do a movement practice – when we use those shift points to *feel* effort in our movement – we are stimulating those cells to get *stronger*. What that means is that they can take in fuel more easily – they can take in oxygen from our red blood cells more effectively – so we can work longer without breathing as hard.\n\nThese cells are not all the same. Some respond more quickly; some respond more slowly. We have a lot more of the slower type of cell. At a first shift point, we are using more of those slower fibers that can go and go – not too fast but for a longer time.\n\nWhen we want to move very fast – sprint – or when we need to lift something quickly – like lifting up a heavy load very quickly – an Olympic snatch is an example – we’re using those faster fibres.\n\nA big difference between these types of fibres is the materials (and processes) they use to move fuel resources into energy to let these fibres move in these ways. The Fast fibres use fuel – phosphocreatine – that is only available in relatively small amounts in a cell. Burn that, with a big sprint, or in a big lift, or big jumps, it takes time for them to recharge, to rebuild that fuel. It takes more time for us to recover, too.\n\n**How Many Fast Fibres**? Genetics plays a big role in the ratio of faster and slower muscle fibres. We all have these types, but some people have a higher ratio of fast twitch than others. But, for general health, that ratio doesn’t matter. What does matter is: making sure to keep these materials, we use these materials. Like any other material in the body, these fibres are use it or lose it. If we don’t work those fast fibres they effectively shut off. This progressive shut off seems to be particularly the case as we get older.\n\nTo work those fibres to keep them on, we have to get to a place where we regularly (once or twice a week) use what those fibres are designed to deliver: fast intense bursts of POWER.\n\nTo get to that place if we are moving, we need to do some pretty near all out efforts: we need to be at that place where we will definitely need to open our mouths to get in enough air; we will not be talking with someone. **We’ll be in sprint territory**. Which may mean sprinting down a road for 50-100m, or it may mean doing agility sprints in a much shorter space, cutting around obstacles.\n\n**Equipment Based Options.** Alternatively, a practice like Olympic lifting – dynamically moving heavy loads rapidly – is great – it however requires equipment, or gym access. Harder to do anytime, anywhere. Another option is **to learn kettlebell snatches**. With the right load and tempo these will get those fast fibres twitching – and it gets your arms more involves with the load – best of all it doesn’t’ take a lot of room in one’s home.\n\n**Jump Rope is another variant** The traditional training of boxers everywhere has also become a more common tool for strength, speed, agility and coordination.\n\n**Another alternative – no equipment required - is jump based movement**: we are compressing our muscles in a jump as quickly as possible and then exploding into the next move as quickly as possible. Bigger jump moves, like jumping up and tucking up our knees to our chest – is one of the BIG jump efforts. In our experiments this week, this is the approach we’re using. Up and Down, side to side, forward and around 180 degrees.\n\n**Jumping DOWN** from a box into practically a squat and then leaping up as fast as possible, is another way to “load the spring”  to work those fibres.\n\n **Take away**: when we combine SPEED with strength movements, like jumping, to where we hit what we might call that second shift point – we’re mouth breathing *hard* – we’re bringing on those fast fibres that are important to build to keep that part of our human resilience – our ability to respond well to multiple situations.\n\n**Being able to go ahead and jump – in multiple directions, with speed and intensity – at least once a week** – is a great way to build that kind of speed/power strength. And it’s once or maybe twice a week\n\nWhy not more frequently? BECAUSE those fibres need time to recover – and so do we. Working at that top end intensity drains our batteries.\n\nBut as we practice that capacity gets bigger. Strength and speed and how much load we can move – all improve. That work also helps build our coordination to be able to respond quickly to a situation whether its moving fast to get a child out of the road, or catch a falling glass, or leap over a wall to get away from an upset dog.\n\nSpeed, power, these too, like movement are all skills. So go ahead and jump."

Or hanging onto a bar, or ledge. Or gritting our teeth.\n\nWhile we don’t SEE much muscle action, we certainly FEEL these actions.  \n\nThese types of still movements have been used for over a hundred years to build strength and stamina.

Grip strength by the way is associated with longevity - so it's going to help with that \"lifetime\" not just of the bar, but you, too. \n\nmain points in the videos you’ll see:\n\n### Basic HANG and HOLD – letting go – while holding on.\n\n![](/public/assets/moves/assisted_pull_up_rest.png)\n\n1. grab the bar – thumb over or around – up to you\n2.        Lower yourself or let yourself hang to the degree that is manageable\n3.        Work towards bringing feet off the ground\n\n       Increase hang time at each phase (eg feet on the ground, one foot off the ground, etc) to hold for at least a minute\n \n\n### \n\n### Shoulder Strengthening\n\n1.        Hold the bar again,\n2.        Lower as much as is comfortable – if feet off the ground, great\n3.        Elevate your shoulders – like shrugging up\n4.        Pause to hold that shrug at the top\n5.        control releasing down to hanging\n6.        repeat\n \nGRIP HELP: A way to help improve your grip/hold on the bar is either to use Coaches Tape where your hands go on the bar – or what you’ll see in the video here – draping a theraband or similar appliance over the bar. You can also use liquid chalk on your hands. It’s ok; it’s not cheating.\n \nAlternatives without a bar.\n\nNothing can really beat a bar or a beam that lets you hang vertically. If that just isn’t an option for you, here are a few ways to approximate the experience:\n\n1. Towel over top of door [image]; hang facing door.\n \n "

FIND where you FEEL the work.  \n\n**A TAKE AWAY:** You can build strength without a lot of space, and without a lot of motion. A move like this L-Sit Prep is fantastic as well for strengthening the gut, the butt, the shoulders, the hands – it’s like a pull up (or dead hang) in reverse. "

Fantastic to note that time. What happens if you hang or push away a little longer? Or how long or short are the pauses between your next hang or push? Can you feel that change from the start to then end of the week – what do you notice? Where in your body? \n \nFor instance, **in the hang** – do you feel space opening between your joints? In the **l-sit prep,** do you feel a better lift off the ground when you pull your head up and extend your spine?  \nYou can always check effects of moves and holds on your wellbeing by trying another movement afterwards. For example, try to touch your toes before and after either of these moves – is the toe touch better or worse? Everything affects everything and all data is good data – it helps complement your shift point experiences to listen to your body. "

            "content": "Jumps\n \n**A great way to feel those shifts is with Jumps for Time.**\nThere are many types of jumps. These include things like simply jumping up, jumping to the side, jumping to turn from front to back, and back again, jumping forward and back.\n\nOther types of jumps may be jumping up onto something, or really powerful: jumping down from something and springing right back up again.\n\nFor upper body to benefit from this approach, this could be leaning into a wall, pushing off and landing back and pushing off again, to hurling a medicine ball at a wall or the floor and catching it.\n\nAn old skool way to incorporate jumps of course is jumping rope.\n\n**We’ll look at why these Shift Points and Jumps are so fundamental in the Knowledge section.**\n\nThis week, you’ll be experimenting with ways to use shift points deliberately to build your skills to be able to move anytime, anywhere, to feel better, longer.\n \n \n**Shift Points with Movement Snacks**.\n\nYou likely experienced shift points last week while focusing on your nasal breathing in some of your movement snacks.\n\nThis week – a focus is at least in one of your movement snacks – keep going with a move till you need to open your mouth to breath – and just go a little longer at that intensity to see how you feel.\n\nWhat happens as you hit that point? What are you saying to yourself when you hit that point? What strategies do you use to keep going?\n\n\n\n**EXAMPLE** For instance, you might set a clock for 1 minute, start with the intent to nasal breath as long as possible, and do monkeys non stop to be as slow and controlled as possible – you may even try *pulling*  your feet rather than leaping from one side to the other to use more effort.\n\nWhen do you get to the point of needing to breath with your mouth? Is it in that first minute, in the second minute? Or it may be easier to say is it the third monkey to the left or the fifth?\n\nAnother context may be taking the stairs up: if you’re moving at a good tempo – to move as quickly as you can safely – perhaps you take two stairs at a time even – what flight do you hit where you need to start breathing through your mouth? How do you feel? Energised? Fatigued? Can you do a few more stairs? What are you telling yourself?\n \n**Shift Points with Jumps**\n\nJumping offers an opportunity to focus on generating power – a combination of speed and force – we’ll look at what that means and why it’s fundamental for health in the knowledge section.\n\nThe idea here is to explore jumps to find that shift point – when you need to shift from nasal to mouth breathing to keep going – or do you feel fatigue even before you need to shift breathing?\n\nIF jumping is new to you, this video is a great jump tutorial from our friends at GMB\n\n[embed] 9Q6enxidXeo?si=ioU4JGhyPsJMOHvP\n\nWhile the video shows jumps being done outside – they can also be done inside, and in quite small spaces.\n\nTry out these jumps – up and down, side to side, forward (broad) jump\n\n**NOTE: start where you are** The**** height or length of a jump to start is immaterial. The main thing is the movement quality: to bring your arms into play; to use that hip movement you’ve practiced in the animal moves. You can practice those moves with the smallest of leaps off the ground. If leaving the ground is too much right now, explore just doing the movement towards the leap – explore going up on your toes with your arms up – you’ll build up to it.\n \n**Bonus –upper body “jumps”**\n\nYou can explore finding shift points in working upper body “jumps” as well. You can start with a wall, and work your way to the floor for equipment free work. – or use medicine balls and bands too to build this vital practice.\n\n**6wSTLKlOqeM?si=8DTmLrST0-nirkZ1**\n\n**zDvwU3Z8Y-g?si=T24nGRMZ-HIzNclN**\n\n**/pyK_JUWufZY?si=FCXDPokX7fCQkawj**\n\n**LjEY1ZY67TM?si=yZuf9tBewirBjO4E**\n**** \nPREPARATION for these Bigger Moves Practice to Shift Point Exploration:\n\n·      Give yourself time and space to explore the Jumps from these videos– what feels ok to you?\n\n·      It’s important to give yourself time at the start of the week to test out how long or hard you need to do a movement snack move – whether a crab walk or doing stairs to find that shift point of\n\no   Mentally, feeling like this has moved into work, or you’d like to stop\n\no   Physically, feeling the need to breath through your mouth\n\n·      Have a think about how you’ll work some of these efforts into any of your movement snacks this week to find the shift points – and how to move beyond the shift point before pausing.\n\n·      Be sure to explore 30-60 seconds of continuous jumps within your movement  snacks at least once a day this week.\n \n \n**Breath Walking Shift Points**\n\nThis week with nasal breath walking we’re exploring a kind of micro shift point. Here’s how it works:\n\nDuring your outside walk:\n\n·      Breath regularly in and out through your nose for 6 breaths – in and out\n\n·      Notice how many steps you take with each breath: is it two? Three? Four?\n\n·      After you have your sixth breath OUT (last exhalation of this cycle) hold your breath (it can help to pinch your nose).\n\n·      Count how many steps you can walk til you feel the FIRST need to breath again, and then, gently breath in and out nasally for another 6 breaths and start the cycle again.\n\nThis practice is NOT about trying to hold your breath as long as possible – it’s about staying loose and relaxed and noticing when that air hunger starts to happen and you want to breath. Do so. As you practice this walking breathing breath-holding this week, just notice what happens in terms of how the step count may change. Over time, you’ll find that your step count increases in the breath hold. You’ll also find that your pace – how quickly you can walk and do this breathing and recovering will also improve.\n\nNote: if you find yourself having to breath in really extra deeply after your breath hold, you’ve likely tried to hold it too long. The recover breathing should be at a normal breathing level.\n\nNote 2: walking while practicing this breathing is a great way to improve nasal breathing work for your movement snacks as well.\n \n \nSnack tracking as they happen:\n\n1.

Locations that felt easiest?\n\nWhat did you notice today about snacks that may have surprised you\n\n[text]\n \n \nBecause we’re focussing this week on hanging and holding, we’re going to add in some wrist, hand and finger movements.\n \nzrcuBwZsHXo?si=yZ_Dzbk18fRz7l6s\n \n \nmain points in the videos you’ll see:\n\n\n\nBasic HANG and HOLD – letting go – while holding on.\n\n    /public/assets/moves/assisted_pull_up_rest.png\n1. grab the bar – thumb over or around – up to you\n\n2.        Lower yourself or let yourself hang to the degree that is manageable\n\n3.        Work towards bringing feet off the ground\n\n4.        Increase hang time at each phase (eg feet on the ground, one foot off the ground, etc) to hold for at least a minute\n \nShoulder Strengthening\n\n1.        Hold the bar again,\n\n2.        Lower as much as is comfortable – if feet off the ground, great\n\n3.        Elevate your shoulders – like shrugging up\n\n4.        Pause to hold that shrug at the top\n\n5.        control releasing down to hanging\n\n6.        repeat\n \nGRIP HELP: A way to help improve your grip/hold on the bar is either to use Coaches Tape where your hands go on the bar – or what you’ll see in the video here – draping a theraband or similar appliance over the bar. You can also use liquid chalk on your hands. It’s ok; it’s not cheating.\n \nAlternatives without a bar.\n\nNothing can really beat a bar or a beam that lets you hang vertically. If that just isn’t an option for you, here are a few ways to approximate the experience:\n\n\n1. Towel over top of door [image]; hang facing door.\n\n    public/assets/moves/door_hang_pull_rest.png\n\n2. doorway lay backs – one or two hands – can both hang and do shrugs from this position.\n\n3. table holds – likewise can hang from this position – can adjust legs to offer as much support as needed to support the hold.\n \nA powerful move that combines a push and a pull in a still movement is the floor L-Sit.\n\nThe idea is with hands on the ground PUSH DOWN into the ground, and chest up PULL your butt UP off the floor – and PULL your feet towards you.\n\nhRlJ0kJNzmM?si=79UvptGRnq-5h1W6\n\nhere’s some great tips from Ryan Hurst at GMB\n\n7pTS7h9Kz2Y?si=m-VmTZo2NVXAbjjw\n \n \n**Nasal Breathing Walk** –\n\nThis week you’re exploring the skills you’ve been building with the breath hold after 6 inhales and exhales while walking\n\n·      check your step count for holding your breath comfortably and then releasing.\n\n·      during your next breath hold, try to up your walking pace – see what happens to your step count before that first need to breath comes back?\n\n·      Also check what happens to your re-breathing: do you breath harder, faster, more deeply to recover?\n\n·      In your next round, see what happens if you\n\no   Up your pace again\n\no   Hold your breath on your 6th exhale AND this time hold it for as many paces as you did at your regular pace – so pushing into a shift point where it will take a little more effort to keep holding your breath.\n\n·      Restart this cycle.\n\n·      During recovery breathing before next breath hold – explore trying to breath as normally as possible, rather really breathing harder or deeper than normal. **FOCUS ON BREATHING as lightly as possible in recovery** – this is working on adapting to a feeling of air hunger, building strength.\n\n·      Keep a mental note of the shift points; how getting to a normal re-breathing between holds feels when you may feel like you’re breathing in less than you need – see what happens after those first few seeming less that deep full recovery breaths but light normal breaths – you may need more than 6 of these breaths but you may find that your breathing rate settles into your normal.\n \n "

Your nasal breathing walk.  Again, that walk is best done outside, but if the weather is dire, inside is dandy. Better to do than not do.  \n\nPRACTICE NOTES:   \n\nMicro movements AM/PM– How does it feel to start the day and end the day with these movements? What are you noticing about your mobility around these joints?  \n\nCORE FOCUS IN THIS EXPERIMENT: MIX IN Dead Hang and L-Sit Prep Moves into your Movement Snacks For your movement snacks this week, the idea is to BLEND IN a few Dead Hangs and L-sit preps. You can do a few of each, together,  as a snack or blend them with your animal moves or whatever other movement effort you like to do – swing a kettlebell, lift weights - across the day.  \n\nThe goal is to practice a Dead Hang and an L-Sit Prep each, at least once a day. Keep ONE go as 60 seconds. So 60 seconds of wherever you are at with your dead hang. That’s once. 60 seconds of wherever you’re at with your L-Sit prep.  \n\nWith the l-sit prep – see how long you can hold any of the positions – for instance butt off the ground with legs out; butt off the ground with feet pulled in; one leg out and hold; other leg out and hold. \n\nWith the Hang – again the focus is in the hang and hold – so use as much foot support as you need so that you can hang and hold for a minute. It SHOULD feel like a challenge but not insurmountable. Check where your shift points are during the hold, and KEEP NOSE BREATHING IN AND OUT. \n\nNasal Breathing Walk – remember to see how you feel during your walk – if you’d like to add in your breathing in and out for 6 times, and on the last exhalation hold your breath for as many steps as you wish – where is your Shift Point – when you want to breath in again?  \n\nHow does your walk feel with the hanging and pushing work this week? How are you feeling?  "

When in a meal do you go from not full, to starting to feel full, to full or possibly right to feeling overfull? \n2. If you usually hit “overfull” during a meal, before ever really feeling full – what do those experiences have in common? For instance, \n3. Does the food you’re eating make a difference to how and when you feel full/overfull? \n4. Does the speed at which you complete your meal affect when or if you feel full? \n5. Does who you are with or where you are make a difference to when and if you are aware of fullness?\n\n**THE VALUE of LEARNING your FULLNESS FEELINGS** These simple checks about when fullness starts– along with how what you’re eating or doing affects you, helps you build your own knowledge and insights about how your body responds  not only to the type of food, but to how quickly or slowly you eat it. Even chewing on a bite of food to focus on getting at more of the flavour and texture can affect that fullness feeling. "

Plan Ahead: Which MEAL would you like to OBSERVE for Feeling Full? \n\nIt’s a great idea to plan ahead which meal of any given day you’d like to OBSERVE how you feel full. You can do every meal if you wish, or change which meal you look at any day of the week. Either way, we’ve found folks tell us that planning ahead helps ensuring at least once a day you can do this check-in with yourself. \n \n\n2. WHO else needs to know? If there are other folks you eat with, how and when might you let them know that you’re running this experiment, so they can support you. Who knows? They might wish to run this experiment with you.  \n \n3. PREP YOUR PLACE: reminders. One of the things we hear from a lot of participants is that they have forgotten to observe full for a meal – especially if it’s a family meal or an outing or at work with other people around.  \n\n [IMAGE] [image]\n\n1. NOTES where you’ll see them. You can leave a note at your table or stuck to a lunch bag or wherever works for you, just to remind yourself what you want to check. Here’s an example of a reminder note that records meal start time, whether full was hit within the meal or after.  \n \nUsing their own code, this Eat Box Scientist’s filled in note shows \n \nMeal started at 6:05pm \n\nFeeling fuller was D(uring) the meal about 5 minutes (+5) into eating \n\nFull happened P(ost) the meal  \n\nDid not get to over-full. \n\nWhat’s not clear is if the fullness at +20 means 20 minutes after the end of the meal or 20 minutes from that 6:05 start. \n\nHow would you make that note clearer for your own recollection? \n\nWe’ve also seen some creative ways to make sure the reminders are not forgotten – like this one of putting the note on an object the participant uses during meals: the pepper grinder \n \n\n[image]\n\n4. Plate Checks \n\nWith your lab kit set up, here’s some ideas to help you tune your observations for feeling full-ness: \n\n1. PLATE CHECK: before you start eating, just take a look at what's on the plate: does it look like it *should* be enough food for that meal, at that time of day?  \n2. SELF-CHECK: check in with yourself - how do you feel? ready to eat? You could go longer, right now without food? You’re really ready for food?  \n3. MEAL DONE: end of the plate: how do you feel right now? not quite full, over full? Are you thinking about seconds? \n4. MEAL PACE do you think you ate \"fast\"? How long did the meal last – make it easy: over or under 20 minutes? What do you think contributed to the meal going at the pace it did? For example, food type (soup vs steak?) or conversation with people during the meal? Deliberately small/light meal? \n \n\nFantastic! \n\nIn the next section, you’ll see the entries for your lab book to help make recording and reflecting on your observations as easy as possible.  "

            "content": " \nThe following practices are designed to help explore fullness \n\n1. The power of STAND UP; WAIT A MINUTE.   \n2. If you do not feel full by the end of your meal – and if seconds are available –before having them, wait for a few minutes to feel for fullness. To help, you can try standing up and looking out a window – no kidding. Just see if your fullness awareness starts to change. Does it?  \n3. What happens if you sit back down after that momentary stand, look at something else? \n4. CHEWING - for taste and time – raw or cooked \n5. Our jaws apparently evolved for LOTS of chewing. Cooking and other kinds of food preparations have reduced the need to chew as much. One strategy to aid fullness can be: chew longer – even with soft stuff – in order to squeeze out flavours. Take time in each morsel to find that flavour.  \n6. Chewing food more has the advantage of helping our gut extract as much nutrient value as possible from what we eat.  \n7. FOOD ORDER  - You may find that eating chewier foods first helps with getting to feeling full, better.  \n8. The Raw and the Cooked. Raw vegetables are often chewier than cooked – for a quick what veggies work raw: generally speaking vegetables that grow above ground can be eaten either raw or cooked.  \n9. What order of eating what foods helps you start to feel full in a meal? What does not? \n10. TIME to taste. The 20 minute win.  We start to feel full because of the foods we eat, and what signals they set off in our guts, starting with what we taste and chew. These signals are fast, but they do take time. We can use time to help even out getting to full rather than skating right past to over full by using time in a couple ways:  \n11. Start the Clock – you may wish to see what happens if you have a little something food-wise to start sending those food signals to your brain about 20 minutes before you have your real meal. See if that helps your finding full \n12. Take Your Time to TASTE – there’s related research that suggests taking about 20 minutes to eat a meal is also helpful for finding full.  \n \n13. Portions by Hand In case you’re wondering about how to think about whether your plate of food should get you to full or not, here’s a great guide from the folks at Precision Nutrition to help: \n \n\nAs per the diagram, a palm is a serving of protein like fish, yogurt, protein powder, eggs, tofu; a fist is a serving of veggies like spinach, peppers, broccoli; a cupped hand is a serving of what you might call “underground veg” like potatoes, or grains like oatmeal or rice, or legumes like lentils and a thumb is for fats like nuts, seeds, butter, cheese. \n\nThe great thing about hand sizes is that they’re custom sized for the individual – and they’re always with you.  \n\nThis week – you might want to use hand sizes just to reflect on figuring out full. You don’t have to do anything else than observe and reflect: for example, check your meals -   \n\nHow many palms of a protein do I have right now? If I have two along with at least the single servings of the others, should I be full? If I’m not and I Stand and Wait, and then sit down again – do I get to full? If not, what might I explore?  \n\n6. What are your experiences? What combination of any of these tips helps you find full? How does reaching full during your meal help you eat and feel better? Any surprises? All data here is great data! "

This week, with Green and Red, you’re exploring how particular food types affect feeling full, and also, how they affect feeling better – like having more energy, sleeping better, thinking more clearly.\n\n**What are Greens and Reds?**\n\nGreen means Green Vegetables - Red means Protein: meat, fish, eggs - and if Vegan: mushrooms, legumes. \n \n**Why Green and Red?** The Value of Green and Red is that these are Reliable Foundations for everything your body needs in order to build, burn and recover better. When in doubt about what to have, anytime, anywhere, that’s all you need to check out: where is the green? Where is the red? and you’re covered. \n\nThe other great thing is that you can use your senses especially vision, but also touch, to determine these foods.  \n\n**Only Green and Reds? No, just R&G** *first*.\n\nThe focus this week is not to take away any particular foods, but to make sure, for at least this one week, you START every meal with Green and Red, and then WAIT – stand up, move around, pause, chat, whatever for a few minutes – and if you still feel the need for more food, have whatever else you’d have.  \n\n**Does “Every time you eat” mean EVERY time you eat?**\n\nYes – this week, this experiment – it does mean EVERY time you eat.\n\nIf you like to have a cookie, a piece of toast, a can of pop – anything that has material in it that your gut needs to process, start with Red and Green and Wait – and if you still want that Other Thing, have it. Notice how you feel after the “wait” – are you feeling like you need food? Is it a craving instead? What would happen if you had a bit more Red or Green instead?"

            "content": "**REDS are proteins - Meat, Legumes, Mushrooms, Fish, Poultry**\n\nUsually, when you hear about protein and humans, it’s about muscle. While muscle is definitely built from protein, **Protein** isnt just about muscle; it’s about everything. Everything in our bodies, pretty much, is made up of proteins. Hair, skin, hormones. All our billions of cells use proteins in their nucleus to re-create themsleves from their DNA. Growth, repair, recovery, everything needs protein. In particular, there are a set of proteins (or really the building blocks of proteins, called *amino acids*) that we HAVE to consume, pretty much daily.\n\n**Why protein daily: we don’t really have mechanisms to let us store protein.**\n\nIf you’ve ever said to yourself  “I’d like to lose some weight” we’re talking about, most of the time, wanting to burn off some fat.\n\nIn other words, we can store fat in our bodies over days, weeks, months – longer. We are designed to store that fat so we can have a constant fuel supply for our cells’ energy needs.\n\nJust like our cells need protein as the raw materials to make us, those same cells also need fuel to run the cellular engines to *make* those proteins do stuff to keep us alive. It’s like having all the gear we may have at home like a vacume cleaner, a water heater, a TV, a fridge. Those things are great, but if the power goes out, there’s a black out, they’re useless. Nothing happens. Our fat acts like a battery – stored fuel that gets converted on demand to energy for running our cells. Sometimes we have more batteries than we can use – and that actually causes problems. But that’s another story.\n\n**Unlike our ability to store fat for energy, we don’t have big reserves for those proteins.**\n\nBecause we only have very small “amino acid pools” in our bodies, that get used up over the day, we need to take in the proteins we need from our food, to replenish the pools for our body’s constant growth/repair/recover cycles.\n\nPROTEIN SOURCES Meat, fish, poultry – creatures, in other words – are available to us as food as mostly protein. These meat sources also tend to have some of the fats we need for both fuel and other stuff too – our cells’ walls, for instance, are made up of mostly fats; transport systems used by the blood (cholesterol) to carry materials back and forth from the liver are made up of fats and proteins.\n\nDairy & Eggs also include protein – not as much relative to the other food components they have.  \n\nPlants All plants have pretty much all the amino acids we need, but not in the amounts that we need to thrive. Consequently,  it takes more care to put together plants to make sure we get the protein components we need, regularly enough, to thrive. Vegans who have committed to learn how to put the time in to build up healthful meals from solely plant sources make this work for them every day – but it does take work.\n\nFEELING FULL One of the cool things about protein is that when we get them from our food, those protein-rich foods take the longest to break down in our guts – so they tend to help us feel satisfied longer. So you can check that out, too this week in terms of both finding full and when you WAIT – after having the Reds and Greens – how long you feel satisfied.\n\n**GREENS**\n\nThis week the plant focus is JUST on greens. Why, of all the possible plants, focus on just GREEN vegetables?\n\nIt’s like this: when in doubt go for greens first. Greens have more of the nutrients needed to thrive than any other plant cousin. Go for rich dark leafy greens or cruciferous (eg broccoli) and you’re covered.\n\nWhy?\n\nProteins as shown above are ESSENTIAL for you to survive and thrive.\n\nFor proteins to function – for the body to be able to make use of these amino acids for different processes whether fighting a cold or building muscle– there’s a need for other *nutrient components*  to be available that may not be present in various protein sources to be sufficient.\n\nIn other words, for proteins to combine to make stuff from hair to hormones, they need a variety of different ingredients either to facilitate or to be part of that material-making process.\n\nYou can think of all the different things in the world that use wheat grain: cakes, cookies, breads, beers. Flour is the foundation, but to deliver different flavours and textures, different additional materials are needed. Flour can’t do anything on its own. Flour with water and sugar can make desert; flour with water and salt completely different – but only one small ingredient has shifted.\n\nSame with Greens. You’ve likely heard about **vitamins and minerals**. These components – and may other bits (called phytonutrients)  - are found in both plants and creatures.\n\nFor example, iron is an essential mineral for our blood to be able to process the air we breath – that is – without it, oxygen cannot be carried from the lungs to our cells. Without oxygen getting into our cells, they can’t produce energy for those necessary processes to keep us alive. We could breath in all the air in the world: no iron; no life. No kidding.\n\nIron is available in food from creatures. But a cup of cooked spinach has *way* more iron. In fact it’s got about 5 times as much iron as 3oz (100g) of steak. You have to go to chicken liver to beat a cup of spinach.\n\nSpinach, kale, asparagus, brussel sprouts, broccoli, avacados (all greens) also are rich in a range of vitamins and minerals, not least the B vitamins that have a whole host of properties to help proteins build materials, and especially help in particular help with energy production.\n\nThese same veggies are also great sources of vitamin C, used for protecting our cells when they’re producing energy. Think of pollution associated with energy production – our cells do something similar when producing energy with “reactive oxygen species” – stuff that creates “rust” in the cells. When we eat foods that bring in vitamin C – like these greens – our bodies use those materials to help clean out the rust, and keep our cells functioning both better and longer.  \n \n**NOT JUST REDS or GREENS**\n\nWhat about all those other foods – like grains and different coloured vegetables.\n\nWe’re not saying at all ONLY green veg have these. What we’re saying is that Red and Green are your Go-To sources for getting all the *essential* nutrients you need to thrive. No matter where you are, if you go for red and green first, you know you’ll be in fine shape. They’re a solid foundation for your *feeling better* journey.\n\n**Heuristic this week: Focus on the experience of Reds and Greens**\n\nWhat to look for in greens: DARK green in colour; leafy, or cruciferous in texturegrown above ground. Yes avacados are fine as a SUPPLEMENT green choice this week, but not as a PRIMARY green.\n\nWhat to look for in Reds: main nutrient – protein (https://feastgood.com/highest-protein-foods/). For **creature sources**, this is easy: protein is the highest nutrient -so any creature source from sea to land to air is grand. **In plants**, protein will most often be the second highest or even third hightest nutrient. Soy beans are one plant exception: protein is the highest nutrient in that plant (https://www.nutritiontable.com/nutritions/nutrient/?id=864). That just means more weight of a serving is protein than anything else.\n "

            "content": "YOUR LAB SET UP: WHAT is Green? What is Red?  \nYour lab set up this week includes:  \n\n1. Greens and Reds – identifying Reds and Greens – for your groceries or when eating out \n2. Planning  and Prepping   Green and Reds for the types of meals you typically have to be ready to go for each time you eat throughout the week. \n3. Connecting with anyone – from family to friends - who might like to know what you’re trying – whether to invite them along, or to help with meal prep for the week, or for any kind of planning from shopping to eating out.  \n  \nFeel free to check out ideas for how to prep your lab for this experiment \n\nSECTIONS\n\n[ What are Greens and Reds : Examples  ( **new page this is the inside lab set up page greens and red**)]  \n\nWhat are Greens and Reds? In this experiment there are some simple heuristics for Greens and Reds. Greens are dark green colored leafy to curly vegetgables. Reds are proteins.  Some examples below: \n\nGreens are literally GREEN vegetables.  \n\n[image greens]\n\nIn particular, these greens - you can eat pretty much as you’d like: dark leafy greens like spinach, collard greens, spring greens, brussel sprout tops, beet tops. There’s also the cruciferous greens like broccoli, kale, arugula, bok choy.  If you’re in doubt, or don’t want to fuss – just go for the darkest green veggies you see in the fresh (or frozen) sections of the market or grocery.  \n\nHeroes in this space are Spinach and Broccoli. It’s easy to get frozen versions of each too, and they’re often less expensive and sometimes more nutritious.  There are many other greens and other cruciferous veg. We’re focusing here on the dark green ones.  \n\nReds  \n\n[image reds]\n\nA red is code for Protein. Protein is a particular type of nutrient that is essential for us to live. If you eat meat, you can think of your RED sources as: creatures. That is, anything with Eyes (or that would have had eyes). Typical reds are red meats like cow or venison. There’s also fish, chicken, eggs, other kinds of sea foods. Less typical reds are insects.  \n\nFor  plant based eaters like vegetarians, eggs are great sources of protein and other healthful nutrients. The ratios in dairy are not bad – but you need more of these sources than the equivalent weight in meat to get the equivalent amount of protein. That’s not bad; it’s just to be aware of when planning your eating times.  \n\nFor more exclusively plant-based eaters, great non-eyed sources of protein are legumes: soy, turtle beans, black beans, pinto beans, lentils. Here, instead of red as your main visual cue, think about small, usually dark in colour or practically white things. When they are dried – how they’re typically sold “raw” – their texture is also hard, sometimes smooth; sometimes more wrinkly.   \n\nThere’s also things like Setain that are refined from grains proteins, and Qunioa which is a grain that just happens to be higher in protein than most other grains.  \n\nNuts, nut butters, seeds and cheeses also supplement this space. By supplement, that while they have protein, that’s not their primary nutrient. Plant based eaters are better off – most of the time – looking for their red-equivalents to be as rich in that Protein as possible.  \n \nOTHER REDS - FUNGI (mushrooms)  \n\n[image shrooms]\n\n  \nMushrooms have a reputation as being good protein sources. in 100g (3oz) only about 5-7g of protein will be there, pending type of mushroom. So they are more a complement among other sources than perhaps a primary.     \n\nBut thinking about complements is the way to think about plant proteins.   You get protein through plant combos:  EVERY whole plant in the green scene has protein. Veggies all have some protein, so it's pretty straight ahead to get protein and lots of other nutrients from plants. Those chickpeas, greens, seeds, 'shrooms - voila.    \n\nNote 1:  Protein is found in MANY MANY food sources including grains and other vegetables – including the greens mentioned here. Many other vegetables have many great qualities too besides greens.  \nFor just this week, however, we’re focusing on upping the green/red experience as an experiment – a special test -  in order to assess how that kind of red/green experience helps you FEEL better.  \n\nIt make life simple: when in doubt about what to have – go red and green first. That’s it. \n\nNOTE 2: you’re not being asked to eat ONLY Green and Red – just for this week to START with green and red FIRST – and if still looking for FULL – have anything else you’re having, after that.  See how YOU feel – during the day, the next day; how you sleep – just see how you feel when you up your green and red. \n \n\n### [Meals and Snack ideas Greens and Reds:  Ideas and Strategies] \n\nPlanning and Prepping Red and Green for the Week. \n\nTo help think about the greens and reds you might want to fix during the week, let’s look at some Green and Red Meal ideas. These are not the only ideas, of course – your community may have even more strategies and experiences to share. \n\nIf you eat breakfast,  for instance, and you usually have oatmeal (obviously beige, so not a green or a red), what will you have instead, to get your green and red in, first?  \n\nNote, nothing wrong with oatmeal - but for this week - we're checking out concentrating Green and Red – as well as exploring how they can be used – and how they feel – when eaten across the whole day.   \n\nExamples of Red and Green for breakfast include things like:  \n\n- EGGS and SPINACH. Spinach can be a frozen spinach ball – pour hot water over it, and drain it – or after draining throw it into the skillet that cooked your egg  [you tube embed – julia child 45 second egg [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qCi-buLGPM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qCi-buLGPM)]  \n- With a BLENDER - Have a protein shake with protein powder or yogurt or a raw egg and spinach or kale or greens powder or left over greens as a foundation.  For more ideas for morning “super shakes” our friends at Precision Nutrition have many suggestions [https://www.precisionnutrition.com/super-shake-creation](https://www.precisionnutrition.com/super-shake-creation)] \n \n \n- FISH – like sardines and some greens – if you had kale the night before and have left overs, it’s easy to reheat in a pan or with pouring some boiling water over them and straining.  Frozen spinach balls are also fantastic here – as they can be loosened up by putting in a cup of boiling water for a few minutes. \n- Dal PALAK - LENTIL STEW with SPINACH  - is great for making a bunch on Sunday that can last through the week. It can be made totally vegan, or with dairy, or with vegetable broth or chicken broth – it’s up to you. And if you make a whole lot – you can freeze in individual portion sizes, too, for fast access during the week for ANY meal of the day.   Here’s just ONE of a million recipes for this dish [https://lynnecurry.com/lentil-spinach-stew-recipe/] \n\nSnack Times Challenge: If you usually have an afternoon cookie with your cup of tea, what green and red will you have prior to that cookie? POSSIBILITY – you may be so satisfied by your breakfast or lunch that you forego a snack entirely. That’s ok, too. Else – raw broccoli and some walnuts can be an energy power hit.  \n\nExamples of Lunches (in a Box) Especially if you have lunch at work, salads in reusable containers are fantastic.  \n\n- SALADS! Mixed salad greens for the greens, or spinach alone or kale alone. For Reds: Chunks of TOFU (may be white but they rate as a plant based RED) with cooked lentils/beans, and a sprinkle of seeds like sunflower and seasame and pumpkin seeds, perhaps some walnuts. If you do dairy – a few crumbled bits of feta can be a lovely tang.  Other Reds – may be tinned fish – small tins can even wait to be opened onto the greens until lunch time.  \n\nExamples of Dinners – the Family Challenge \n\nEspecially if this is your main meal with your family, remember – neither you nor your family are restricted to ONLY red and green. It’s just for YOU, you’re experimenting this week to START with Red and Green before having anything else. \n\nWe’ve found that having conversations in advance with your family about how to support your experiment AND not cause a lot of (or any) additional meal prep is a good idea.  \n\nFor instance, if you’re the only person having a green, frozen spinach balls, raw broccoli sticks – or fast steamed broccoli tips - offer an easy way to do an individual serving to meet your experiment – with very low prep time. Raw veg, as per week 1’s experiment, also takes a little more energy to chew.  \n\nIn other words: for family dinners you’re probably having a RED of some kind already. Now it’s just making sure at least YOU have that green available.  \n  \n\n[Shopping and Prepping for your own Greens and Reds] \n\nWHEN you SHOP – tag teaming? \n\nIf you go in person, you can create a Sunday ritual – with family and friends if not just yourself: shop and chop – pick up your groceries for the week, and on Sundays prep meals for the rest of the week. You can cook mince in big batches, or stews, or broths on Sunday to have through the week – to freeze some or keep in the fridge (or in cold weather in tubs in the snow outside if that space is available).  \n\nBuying in bulk – among friends can help with costs too, and perhaps you can support each other on this EAT journey together.  \n\nIF you’re an online shopper with grocery delivery it can be even easier to outsource gathering groceries and delivering them to you.  \n\nEASY GREENS AND REDS: When you shop Pick EASY Greens and Reds to Start. -   \n\n1. Cans can be your friend to get going: canned fish can make sardines and greens in the morning easy. A can of black beans or chick peas – easy usually cheap protein either out of the can, or to make humus or veggie burgers. \n2. Eggs can be super fast to prepare: a scrambled egg or omlette takes less than half a minute to cook in a fry pan. Or – even faster - go all Rocky boxer training and have raw eggs in your morning Shake or Smoothie blended with greens. \n3. FROZEN – also excellent. Frozen veg are often flash frozen as soon as picked – same with fish – so that fresh goodness is locked inside. Frozen also lets you quickly grab enough green or red for individual servings, and pop the bag back in the freezer.  \n4. A bag of salad, of spinach, any greens will stay fine in the fridge for a week.   \n5. RAW or COOKED – Dual Use. VEG and PROTEIN that can be had raw or cooked gives you even more options. Spinach: raw or cooked; sashimi (raw fish) or cooked or smoked or steamed (makerel or sardines). Options options options! \n\nOn the Go? TAKE your R&G WITH YOU.  \n\nThe easiest way to make this week work for you during the day if you’re at work is to Take Your Lab With You. If you're away from your own kitchen, having lunch worked out for the right green and red to pack up the day before is super handy, so you don't have to think about what to have.  \n\nAnd to take it with you: REUSABLE CONTAINERS are a gift that keeps giving – well beyond this week’s experiment. Many types and sizes – just check they’re food grade plastic (polyproplene most of the time), and can be frozen, dishwasher safe.  \n\nThese containers are great as lunch boxes and also for storing individual portions.  \n \nBASIC TOOLS: if you have a very basic kitchen – no worries. A cooking show on radio in Canada on the CBC once said: they only tools you REALLY need to prepare almost anything is (1) a good sharp Chef’s Knife (it’s about 8 inches long) (2) a wok. The wok is because it can double as a fry pan and a pot if needed.   Many many many of these items can be found at charity shops – especially if you’d like to supplement your kit with a lidded pot and perhaps a skillet for stove top cooking. A big pot is nice for slow cooking stews and broths. \n\nEATING OUT: HAVE IT YOUR WAY \n\nIf you have to eat at a canteen or restaurant, an option is you can check out the menu in advance for your choice of greens and reds. Restaurants are there to serve you - so you can also ask for them to prepare something (like a hamburger wrapped in a lettuce leaf with a side green salad – perhaps instead of fries – for the same price).  \n\nSome folks feel a little hesitant about asking for something not on the menu – and some restaurants may refuse – most will not. Don’t let that stop you. Try it once – if with friends – let them know they can support you in this – that you’re gonna give it a try – and you’ll see: it’s really fine, and eaasy and good places will always try to meet your wishes.  \n\nAMOUNTS of green and red. Let’s reuse last week’s experiment guide for portion sizes: \n \nA typical single serving of a GREEN is what would fill your cupped hands. If it’s just greens however – you can pretty much have as much as you want – assuming a lot of dressing hasn’t been added   \n\nA single serving of a Red - if it's a meat for instance - is the size (and thickness) of the palm of your hand. For adult guys, two palms of protein is a good starting place. For adult gals, it’s one palm to start. See how that goes.  Remember it’s green, red, wait. If after your “wait” you are just not feeling full, you might want to opt for more RED – that protein takes longer to digest so can help you feel full better, longer.  \n  \n\n### [Connecting with your Fellow Eaters]  \n\n[images]\n\n For some folks, eating greens and reds with each meal is absolutely normal. For some folks, eating with colleagues at work, or especially if the main meal makers for the family at home, green and red can be a challenge.  \n\nThe one thing we hear the most about with this box is: the challenge of eating out, or making meals for families not used to green and red. \n\nFor sure it can be challenging to introduce new practices around friends and family for eating – so here’s some tips both for yourself – and for having a conversation with colleagues. \n\n1. Green and Red is not the ONLY thing you can eat, it’s an ordering of important foods – to see what happens if having those first – how you feel both during the meal – where does full happen – and how do you feel during the day and week. \n2. You may let your family and friends know – even before this week – that you’re running an experiment – not a diet. It’s one week to try this out. They may wish to join you; you might have a conversation with your family about if they don’t want to join you – how they can support you – as surely they’d like you to feel as good as possible?  \n3. If they don’t want to eat your greens or reds, and that’s ok – think about using single serving sizes of your greens and reds from frozen or canned sources so you can save what you don’t use. \n4. With kids you might ask them when shopping what Greens they can find in how many types? Dry beans, canned, cooked, even fresh? Explore how they feel, smell – which ones squish?  \n\nWhat strategies have you used to follow this practice this week? By all means note them in your daily reflections part of your lab book for this experiment . \n\n[TIPS]\n\nMany practice tips are sprinkled throughout the Lab Set Up Sections of this experiment. \n\nA few key ones repeated here include the main one being: Plan Ahead \n\n1. Meals – imagine 5 breakfasts, lunches and dinners. Are they all the same each day? different? What meals might be the challenges? \n\n IF green and red is new to you for EVERY meal of the day, take a look at suggestions for how to use green and reds for each meal \n\n2. Sunday Ritual – Have your Greens and Reds gathered on Sunday to clean chop put into containers, or to cook up batches. \n3. Make it EASY – cook up things that are familiar to you for the reds and the greens.  \n4. EXPLORE RAW and COOKED versions of Greens; EXPLORE fresh and frozen versions. \n5. Check out recipes with few ingredients and easy to try – eggs like scrambled are super fast; a can of sardines can be dumped onto a bed of defrosted, heated up spinach. If you wish, splash on some hot sauce.  \n\nINVITATIONS \n\n1. If you’re concerned about people challenging your efforts, plan some time to share what you’re up to with them – that it’s for a limited time – and perhaps ask them to help come up with strategies to support you running your experiment.  \n\nFor the focus of the Experiment itself: \n\n1. How do you feel during the meal? Anything different from other times of eating? If you thought red and green breakfasts might be “weird” what were they? \n2. How do you feel during the week? How’s your energy? Patience? Sleep? \n \n \nWay to go for giving Green and Red a GO! "

For example, if we’ve just had a good read and green meal at noon, and it’s only a couple hours later, but we have a craving, we’re not in a place where we physically *need* to eat something. After all, our guts are still processing that last meal. To our brain, though, that craving can feel very real. And it can distract us from focusing on anything else we need to do.\n\nThis week you're going to use your own inner wiring - in this case, your sense of smell - to help your brain bring in new information to crack the craving crises that lets the craving run you rather than the other way around. \n\nIn this experiment you're going to create some Scent Snacks to use instead of taste snacks to help you feel how you feel better.\n "

Cedar, coloured markers, incense, leather, flowers. Whatever works for you as a nice smell. \n\nWe’ll talk about sources for these aromas in the Lab Set Up Section.  "

Find that time slot where you can commit to have that meal at that time – or as close to that time each day this week as possible.  \n\nSo if your first meal of the day is at 7:30am on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday, but Thursday it has to be 7:15 or 8:10– that’s fine.  The goal is to get those times booked in for you, and as close to the same time as you can.  \n\nRemember:  you’re trying to get your body to connect better with your eating schedule, to work WITH your schedule. The more practices you give your body at that schedule, the better it will get. \n \n\n[image builder]\n\n2. Gather Your Non-Food Smell Sources ahead of time. Before the experiment starts, pull together the scent sources you can have with you easily during the day. There are many non-food smells around us.  Examples include: \n \n\n- Cedar trees, \n-  lavender bushes,  \n- flowers,  \n- incense,  \n- colored markers,  \n- soap.  \n- Essential oils \n- leather \n \nYou don’t always need stuff in a bottle either: Outdoors? Nothing like running a hand along a lavender bush or cedar branch and inhaling the scent. Whatever you enjoy – and whatever you can have close by where you might be working or visiting or driving or doing whatever you’re doing.  \n\nTest out a few smell sources before the experiment and see which you prefer and can have readily available.   See which ones may work better for you in different contexts, too. \n \nThe next section shows your Lab Book for guiding your observations for this experiment.   \n\nJust to cue up for your awareness, you’ll see you’re asked to: \n\n1. make some observations on your planned Eating session  \n2. make some observations on your use of non-food smells between planned eatings. Within that observation, the number of times you used your non-food smells will also be helpful to note.  \n \n \n \n \n \n "

            "content": "## Lab Prep\n\n**Your Lab this week has both Time and Space components:**\n\n**1.     The TIME component is as early as you can in your day get your daylight**\n\n**2.     The SPACE component is: outside – not in a window, but outside, get that unfiltered light.** \n\n- OUTSIDE is KEY: your light dose really does need to be with your head out of doors  - we look at options below \n- START OF YOUR DAY is also important. The closer you can get your outdoor light from the time you wake up, the better –\n\nWhy outside and why as soon as possible are explained in the Background section.\n\n**Questions to help you Prep your Lab to run your experiment this week**\n\n- What do you need to *plan in advance* to ensure you can get 15-20 minutes OUTSIDE as early in your morning as possible this week?\n- Each morning of this five day experiment may be a little different pending your schedules – how will you work in your light each morning? \n- CONDITIONS: Sunglasses Off: Unless you have a particular condition requiring you to keep your eyes covered, the goal here is to keep your sunglasses off for these minutes in order to get that unfiltered daylight. Clouds - even if it’s cloudy, you’ll still get the full daylight dose from that light, so go right ahead. Shade – that’s fine too.\n- OPTIONS for outside actions:\n    - \n    - WALKING – it’s totally fine to do your daylight walking – it might be walking to your bus stop or taking the animals out for their early jaunt. Some of our participants say they have had voice meetings on their phones while walking to get their morning Daylight Dose in.\n    - SITTING/STANDING – also fine to sit, or stand – meditate with your eyes open; have a coffee.\n    - EXERCISE – this too is completely fine if the morning is your time to do your moves – and your environment allows. Go for it.\n\n**** \n\n## Some other Considerations, pending the Season\n\n- WEATHER What’s your weather plan? even it it's chilly or wet, what will let you get outside for that daylight dose?       \n- SEASONAL LIGHT If it's that time of year when it's dark out when you get up - it's still all about getting that bolus of outdoor daylight as soon as you can once the sun is up, and in a way that you won't need to wear sunglasses.   \n- FEEL BETTER TOGETHER: SHARING - is there someone you might invite to share any of these light dose occasions with you? Even if you're not together physically, you might agree to virtually do that morning walk, or coffee - just for you.   \n- Some of our participants say they have had voice meetings on their phones while walking to get their morning Daylight Dose in.\n \n**Any Way You Can** As you can see , the main thing, the PRINCIPLE of interest is – to get that early morning light, outdoors, for 15-20 minutes as early as you can.\n\n**BONUS:** After that morning dose, getting additional doses of daylight outside throughout the day – also very helpful. If you can step outside for a bit at noon over lunch or for a walking meeting or whatever – see how that feels too.\n "

Small rechargeable LED lights also options – the one shown shakes to be turned on and off – and can sit just about anywhere. \n\n**Computer Screens /Phones - –** Just turn down the light level – at night – when it is dark from the time of year – or even in the spring as light stays out later – it’s quite interesting to see how low a computer screen can be set and still be legible – especially when your eyes are light adapted.  \n\n **The Process of Darkening** There’s some work to suggest that these device screens are not THAT disruptive to sleep onset.  That’s great to know – for this week’s experiment to be as clear as possible – you can also consider the various challenges for getting to more darkness more of the time before sleep.  \n\n**Darkness in Sleep – Room/Eyes Prep –** How dark is your room at night? Does light creep in? Perhaps earlier than you wake up? If you cannot get your room blacked out to enjoy that cover during the night, for this week, consider a sleep mask – anything to cover your eyes as you sleep – just for this week. And of course, if you like it, keep it.  \n \n**Conversations** If you live with other folks – what conversations do you need to have to support your explorations of darkness? How might you build these spaces and practices together – before the experiment starts? "

            "content": "There are two key parts to working with darkness deliberately in the hours before sleep.\n\n**One. part** is that humans, in coming down from the trees and moving from loan creatures of the night to social creatures of the day, have evolved to sync up with the light and dark cycles and seasons of the planet.  Physiologically, genetically,  these phases are used to support activity during the light, and to use the darkness for the recovery, repair and consolodation of sleep.\n\n**Dark as opposed to Artificial Light**  - When artificial light is used to extend the length of the day, that light disrupts those natural rhythms the early daylight helps sync up your body’s complex systems that are in turn sunk up with the planet’s night/day (dark/light) phases.\n\nThat light fights with our circadian physiology that seeks to start to wind down and go into our recovery (sleep) state. By working with rhythms the dark end of the day, we help support these natural processes that help us shift gears from our waking active selves to our sleeping, recovery and repairing selves.  \n\nThese shifts include hormones for relaxing, starting into sleep,   – and darkness is a cue that supports those processes towards rest and sleep itself.\n\nWe perceive the shift to darkness by a change in light. The nerves in our eyes detect these light shifts – this is the case even in blindness.\n\n**Night Vision**   A **second part** of working with darkness is to allow our visual system – the system that takes in data from the eyes to process it into meaninful information - to get some practice too.  That practice  - explored in the 15min darkness dunk – allows a very perceivable shift in how we see.\n\nIf we go from a light bright room into a darker room – the room initially appears black wihout discernable colour or shape. Within minutes however our eyes adjust to make use of even the tiniest amounts of light to begin to perceive shape, though not colour to anywhere near the definition in daylight.  In darkness, the rods – the photo receptive nerves in our eyes for low light become more active. If a light is suddenly turned on when our eyes are dark adjusted we can experience brief discomfort from the sudden overdose of light to our sensitized low light senors.\n\nAs with any part of the human system, that capacity to work with darkness is a use it or lose it stremgth and a skill. Using the time in darkness before sleep to wind down can be a practice to see what is apparent in the darkness.\n\n**Why Night Vision**\n\nWhile we are wired to sleep in the darkness, we have scotopic or night vision capabilities – not as precise as our daylight vision, but still good at detecting movement, shape and, with practice, getting better at *seeing in the dark*. Why might we have evolved that skill if we are daylight movers and night sleepers? Is it just a leftover feature from millions of years of evolution? Or something that continued – and continues – to be a benefit for human thriving?"
